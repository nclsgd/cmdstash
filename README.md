# _cmdstash_

**_the command stash_**  
a portable and embeddable shell script micro-framework to create handy command wrappers

---

</div>


This micro-library is designed to be embedded into your projects, enabling you
to create convenient and context-aware command wrappers in the form of
executable shell scripts.  Software requirements have been kept to a strict
minimum to ensure portability across all Unix-like platforms. _cmdstash_ only
depends on a POSIX-compliant shell (i.e., `sh`, Bash, zsh, ksh, _etc._) and
`sed`.

One major objective of this micro-library is to avoid the cluttering large
project with a various collection of shell scripts. It also eases sharing shell
script snippets and functions around all the wrapped shell script commands.

_cmdstash_ is licensed under 0BSD, meaning you can freely copy and paste this
shell script and all the integration recipes into your project (and adapt them
to your needs if necessary) with no copyright notice inclusion requirement.

***TODO: This is a work-in-progress.***
