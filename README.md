# `cmdsta.sh`

_cmdstash_ is a portable and embeddable shell script micro-framework for
creating handy command wrappers as executable shell scripts.

## Key Features

- **Clean integration of shell script recipes**: Easily embed _cmdstash_ into
  your project to create reusable, context-specific command wrappers without
  cluttering your codebase with collections of single-purpose shell script
  files.

- **Portability**: _cmdstash_ should work across all Unix-like systems as it
  only requires a POSIX-compliant shell (i.e. Bourne shell (`sh`), Bash, zsh,
  ksh, etc.) and a POSIX sed implemetation.

- **Ease of use**: _cmdstash_ makes context-specific commands easier to work
  with by providing built-in command descriptions, reusable shell functions,
  and support for command chaining &mdash; allowing you to streamline both
  development and repetitive tasks.

## License

_cmdstash_ is licensed under the 0BSD license, allowing you to freely copy,
modify, and integrate the script into your projects without any copyright
notice requirement.
